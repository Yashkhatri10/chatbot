This project is a basic chatbot application built using Python's Flask web framework and the ChatterBot library. The chatbot is trained on the English language corpus provided by ChatterBot and is designed to interact with users through a simple web interface. The backend handles user messages via Flask routes and responds with appropriate replies generated by the chatbot.
